1.   In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be integer or string and expressions will be      mathematical operators.

     *,/,+,- are mathematical operators

     'hello',6,-87.8 are values
     

2.   What is the difference between string and variable? 

    String : A string is a collection of characters like numbers,letters etc. EX: "vishnu","1vis2","102isvs"
    Variable : Variable is a container that holds a value at a special location in system memory.
    
    EX: var1 = 23        -> var1 is a variable here, it holds 23 at some XYZ address/location in memory
        var2 = "vishnu"  -> var2 is a variable here, it holds string "vishnu" at some  address/location in memory
        
        
3.  Describe three different data types.


   1. Int (Integer) - Int is basically a non-decimal whole number. EX: -1,0,22,4532,-34241 
   2. Float         - Float is any whole number with decimal part. EX: 15.23,-24.24, 3.00 etc
   3. Bool          - Bool is like categorical variable with only 2 outcomes - TRUE and FALSE
   
   
4.   What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?

     Every expression consists of 2 parts - i. Operator ii. Operand (2 + 3)
     
     For the above example + is a operator, 2 and 3 are operands. 
     + - adds given operands
     
     An expression can also contain a function all or simply a variable.
     
     2+ fun(x), X+2 etc
 
    
5.   This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an
     expression and a statement?
     
     An expression is a combination of values,variables and operators which produces some result and it is incomplete in nature.
     EX: 2+3+5 -> result is 10, but it is incomplete.
     
     A statement is a complete line of code which does a specific task.
     Ex: spam = 10.  -> this is a statement which is assigning the value 10 to the variable spam.
     
     
6.   After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain? 
     bacon = 22
     bacon + 1
     
     bacon value remains same i.e., 22
     Even though we did bacon + 1 in the second line, the statement is incomplete, its an expression, we are not assigning it to        any variable.
     
    
7.   What should the values of the following two terms be?
     'spam'+'spamspam'  - 'spamspamspma'  (string concatenation +)
     'spam' * 3         - 'spamspamspma' 
     
     
8.   Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?
     
     Basically there are few naming conventions to name a variable
     In this case, 100 is not a valid one because a variable should never start with a number or operators(+/*- etc)
     
     But we can have a number in between like var1.
     
     
     
9.   What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?

     int(), float() and str() are the 3 functions that we can use to typecast.
     
     EX: x = int(3.5)
         print(x)       -> 3
         
         y = float(22)
         print(y)       -> 22.0
         
         Z = str(10)
         print(z)       -> '10'
         
         
         
10.   Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
      'I have eaten '+99+' burritos'
     
     This expression cause error because we are trying to concatenate a integer which is not possible.
     Correct : 'I have eaten '+'99'+' burritos'
